# This is a work in progress

### Update 1:
I haven't synced certain parts of my config (notably awesome and nvim) here for quite a while. Currently, I'm rewriting the awesome codebase from scratch, and its at a decent stage as of now. Planning to upload all of it here and eventually migrate to a Nix/NixOS based workflow :)

### Update 2:
The rewritten awesomewm code has been fully pushed here! Note that in its current state, it contains certain debug code since I am temporarily developing it via Xephyr.

### Update 3:
Haven't had the time to work on the code for a while, and will be rewriting the awesomewm codebase yet again :\
