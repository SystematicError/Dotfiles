### This is a work in progress

### AwesomeWM dotfiles status
I've neglected this config for a while; this has been the code I've been using ever since I started learning the framework, hence, some bits are quite messy.
In order to address this, I've decided to refactor all the code in the `awesome` directory over to `awesome_neo`, although most of the code still should be structurally the same.
