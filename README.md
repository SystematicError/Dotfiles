### This is a work in progress

## Update:
I haven't synced certain parts of my config (notably awesome and nvim) here for quite a while. Currently, I'm rewriting the awesome codebase from scratch, and its at a decent stage as of now. Planning to upload all of it here and eventually migrate to a Nix/NixOS based workflow :)
